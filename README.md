## Recurse Center - Code for Art

This repo contains starter code for making art (or at least doing visual things) with code, using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

If you have git on your machine, clone this repo with:

```git clone git@github.com:aac/rc-codeforart.git```

The repo contains an HTML file, `index.html`, which contains a canvas element and includes the Javascript files for p5. It also loads `sketch.js`, which contains our code for interacting with p5 and drawing things in the canvas element. In the `empty` branch, `sketch.js` just contains an empty p5.js skeleton. The various branches have different sketches. List the branches with `git branch`.

To see the output of your code, just load index.html in your web browser. (On macOS you can do that from the CLI by entering `open index.html` inside the git repo directory.)

p5.js has a lot of awesome functionality that I won't cover exhaustively. Check out [the reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/) for the full list of included features.

One of the best resources for beginners is Dan Shiffman's book [*The Nature Of Code*](http://natureofcode.com/book/) (featuring RC S1'17 Evan Emolo in the credits). If you're looking for ideas, it's a great place to start. The book uses the Java based Processing programming environment, but there are [p5.js versions of the examples](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js/).

Dan also hosts a YouTube channel called [The Coding Train](http://thecodingtrain.com/) where he walks through a wide range of visual (and other) programming concepts.
